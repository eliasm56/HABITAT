# HABITAT
## Overview
HABITAT stands for **H**igh-resolution **A**rctic **B**uilt **I**nfrastructure and **T**errain **A**nalysis **T**ool. This is a fully-automated, end-to-end geospatial deep learning pipeline designed to map Arctic built infrastructure from &lt;1 m spatial resolution Maxar satellite imagery.

## How to run
### Data setup
Model and data setup for both training and inferencing are controlled by configuration files: (final_model_config.py for training and operational_config.py for inferencing). Within these files, you must specify the ROOT_DIR (root directory) and the WORKER_ROOT, which is the "home base" for your data. WORKER_ROOT should contain INPUT_IMG_DIR and INPUT_MASK_DIR, which hold your training image tiles and training mask tiles, respectively. Specify where you want to save the model weights with WEIGHT_PATH, which should be used later when loading the trained model for inferencing. For example, in final_model_config.py, we have written:

```
class Final_Config(object):

    # Give the configuration a distinct name related to the experiment
    NAME = 'ResNet50-UNet++_allSites_duplicateTanks'

    # Set paths to data

    ROOT_DIR = r'/scratch/bbou/eliasm1'
    # ROOT_DIR = r'D:/infra-master'
    WORKER_ROOT =  ROOT_DIR + r'/data/'

    INPUT_IMG_DIR = WORKER_ROOT + r'/256x256/imgs'
    INPUT_MASK_DIR = WORKER_ROOT + r'/256x256/masks'
    TEST_OUTPUT_DIR = ROOT_DIR + r'/test_output'
    PLOT_DIR = ROOT_DIR + r'/plots/' + NAME 
    WEIGHT_DIR = ROOT_DIR + r'/model_weights/' + NAME
```
INPUT_IMG_DIR and INPUT_MASK_DIR should match eachother, like in the following example:

```   
INPUT_IMG_DIR
└───train
│   │   img_10.TIF
│   │   ...
│
└───val
|    │  img_20.TIF
|    │  ...
|
└───test
|   |  img_40.TIF
|   |  ...


INPUT_MASK_DIR
└───train
│   │   mask_10.TIF
│   │   ...
│
└───val
|    │  mask_20.TIF
|    │  ...
|
└───test
|   |  mask_40.TIF
|   |  ...

```

### Model setup
The final trained model that we use for infrastructure mapping with HABITAT is the ResNet-50-UNet++. However, if you wish to train a completely different model with your own parameters, modify the following section in final_model_config.py:

```
    # Configure model training

    SIZE = 256
    CHANNELS = 3
    CLASSES = 10
    ENCODER = 'resnet50'
    ENCODER_WEIGHTS = 'imagenet'
    ACTIVATION = 'softmax'

    PREPROCESS = smp.encoders.get_preprocessing_fn(ENCODER, ENCODER_WEIGHTS)

    # UNet++
    MODEL = smp.UnetPlusPlus(encoder_name=ENCODER,
                             encoder_weights=ENCODER_WEIGHTS,
                             in_channels=CHANNELS,
                             classes=CLASSES,
                             activation=ACTIVATION)
    
    LOSS = smp.losses.FocalLoss(mode='multilabel')
    LOSS.__name__ = 'FocalLoss'

    METRICS = [smp.utils.metrics.Fscore(threshold=0.5)]
    OPTIMIZER = torch.optim.Adam([dict(params=MODEL.parameters(), lr=0.0001)])
    DEVICE = 'cuda'
    TRAIN_BATCH_SIZE = 16
    VAL_BATCH_SIZE = 1
    EPOCHS = 80

    # Select augmentations
    AUGMENTATIONS = [albu.Transpose(p=0.6),
                     albu.RandomRotate90(p=0.6),
                     albu.HorizontalFlip(p=0.6),
                     albu.VerticalFlip(p=0.6)]
```

### Training a model
After you have chosen your desired parameters in final_model_config.py, train the model, by simply running:
```
python model_train.py
```

You can also execute model training on HPC resources by apppending this command at the end of a job script.

### Inferencing on one satellite image
To use a trained model in operational deployment of the HABITAT mapping pipeline on one satellite image:
```
python full_pipeline.py --image <IMAGE_NAME>
```

### Inferencing on multiple satellite images
To automatically run HABITAT on multiple satellite image on an HPC resource, make sure you have specified in operational_config.py (1) the path that holds the input satellite images, (2) the path that will hold the output polygons maps, and (3) the path that contains the trained model weights (model weights can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wnSIv_oDZlFMHtophpVCiaKSC97uvqEQ?usp=sharing):
```
class Operational_Config(object):

    # Give the configuration a distinct name related to the experiment
    NAME = 'ResNet50-UNet++_allSites_duplicateTanks'

    # Set paths to data

    ROOT_DIR = r'/scratch/bbou/eliasm1'
    WORKER_ROOT =  ROOT_DIR + r'/data/'

    INPUT_SCENE_DIR = ROOT_DIR + r'/alaska_scenes/prudhoe_bay'
    OUTPUT_DIR = ROOT_DIR + r'/inference_output'
    WEIGHT_DIR = ROOT_DIR + r'/model_weights/' + NAME + '.pth'
```
Then you can use:
```
python run_workflow.py
```

In lines 13-15 of run_workflow.py, you can chose how many satellite images in INPUT_IMG_DIR will be input for inferencing:
```
start = 0
end = 5
selected_files = files[start:end]
```

### Accuracy assessment
To assess the spatial and geometric accuracy of detected building footprints, reference building footprints for twelve rural and urban communities from Alaskan and Canadian open governmental datasets were collected (such data from Russia is not publicly available for download). Building footprints for the rural Canadian communities of Baker Lake, Gjoa Haven, Grise Fjord, Igloolik, Kugluktuk, Pangnirtung, and Taloyoak were obtained from the Government of Nunavut’s Planning & Lands Division (https://cs-pals.ca/downloads/gis/). Building footprints for the city of Yellowknife were obtained from the Canadian Open Database of Buildings (https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/lode/databases/odb). Building footprints for the rural Alaskan communities of Atqasuk, Kaktovik, Nuiqsut, and Utqiagvik were obtained through correspondence with the North Slope Borough GIS Division, which can be viewed on the North Slope Borough ArcGIS Portal (https://gis-public.north-slope.org/portal/home/).
